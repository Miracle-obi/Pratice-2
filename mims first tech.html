            <h1>My journey of transitioning into tech</h1>
            <p>I have always been interested in tech because of how cool the name sounds and how broad it is.<p></p>
            <p>Now I'm interested in it because of how cool the pay is, LOL.<p>
            <p>I started fully last year with data analysis, but I stopped half way bacause it seemed too much to comprehend.<p>
            <p> I learnt SPSS and made little money from it, thanks to NDDI organisation.<p>
            <p>I'm delving into Web development and I just enrolled in Mr Timi's free virtual class.<p>
            <p>I know I'll assimilate quickly and do well.<p>
            <p>fingers crossed till then, wish me luck!</p>
